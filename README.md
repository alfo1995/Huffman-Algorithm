# Huffman-Algorithm

**Huffman coding** *is an efficient method of compressing data without losing information. In computer science, information is encoded as bits â€” 1's and 0's . Strings of bits encode the information that tells a computer which instructions to carry out. Video games, photographs, movies, and more are encoded as strings of bits in a computer. Computers execute billions of instructions per second, and a single video game can be billions of bits of data. It is easy to see why efficient and unambiguous information encoding is a topic of interest in computer science*.

*Huffman coding provides an efficient, unambiguous code by analyzing the frequencies that certain symbols appear in a message. Symbols that appear more often will be encoded as a shorter bit string while symbols that aren't used as much will be encoded as longer strings. Since the frequencies of symbols vary across messages, there is no one Huffman coding that will work for all messages. This means that the Huffman coding for sending message X may differ from the Huffman coding used to send message Y*.
